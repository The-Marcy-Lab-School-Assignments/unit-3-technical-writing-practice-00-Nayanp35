### Goal: Write your own “documentation” for the higher order functions
**Your documentation should include:**
- A description of the purpose
- A description of the syntax
- An example
- An explanation of the example
- Any additional notes/details

# Higher Order Functions
**Definition**: A higer order function is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function. 

**Purpose**: The purpose of the higher order functions is to make the code more efficient and abstract.

**Syntax**: 
```js
let animals = ['Lion', 'Tiger', 'Bear'] // Animals array is declared using `let`.
animals.forEach(animal => console.log(animal)) // `.forEach()` higher order function is used to print each animal in `animals` array.
```

- This code snippet will log `Lion`, `Tiger`, `Bear` in console.
